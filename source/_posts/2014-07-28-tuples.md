### Declaring Tuples

Tuples group multiple values of possibly different types. They are declared using parentheses:

~~~swift
let slowTextSpeed = (1, "Slow")
~~~

The type can be explicitly set like so:

~~~swift
let fastTextSpeed: (Int, String) = (3, "Fast")
~~~

You can also name the values for easier access:

~~~swift
var textSpeed = (value: 2, label: "Medium")
~~~

### Getting Tuple Values

Use dot syntax to access the value stored at a given index:

~~~swift
var slowSpeedLabel = slowTextSpeed.1
// -> Slow
~~~

To retrieve some values while ignoring others, use the following syntax:

~~~swift
let (_, fastSpeedLabel) = fastTextSpeed
fastSpeedLabel
// -> Fast
let (fastSpeedValue, _) = fastTextSpeed
fastSpeedValue
// -> 3
~~~

If the values were labeld during declaration, you can access them using their labels:

~~~swift
let speedLabel = textSpeed.label
// -> Medium
~~~

### Updating Tuple Values

Declare tuples as variables in order to be able to update their values, then use dot syntax (with indices or labels) to do so:

~~~swift
textSpeed.label = "Fast"
textSpeed.value = 3
// -> (3, "Fast")
~~~
