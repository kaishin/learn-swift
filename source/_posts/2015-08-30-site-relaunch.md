Soon after the Swift announcement last year, I decided to start writing a series of introductory tutorials for busy people who did not want to wade through the exhaustive official documentation.

The site launched as *learn-swift.co* and managed to draw a few hundred subscribers across Twitter, RSS, and email. After writing the initial batch of posts covering most of the basic concepts, I decided to take a pause to figure out the next steps.

Fast forward a year later. Swift 2.0 is almost out of beta and—better yet—is scheduled to go open-source by the end of the year. To celebrate the occasion, I decided to resume where I left off a year ago.

Today I'm happy to relaunch the site as *Swiftbits*. Here's a rundown of the most salient changes:

- New design, including a new logo.

- New RSS feed. [Re-subscribe here]({{ site.feed }}).

- All tutorials were updated for Swift 2.0 and grouped under their [own category](/tutorials).

- New code examples. Bonus points if you get all the references.

- The exact version against which the code samples were compiled can be visible at the top of each tutorial.

- Playgrounds were replaced with Swift source code; it's more versatile and comes with less overhead.

Follow Swiftbits on [Twitter]({{ site.twitter }}) to stay in the loop.

Happy Swifting!
