backtrack a bit and have a look at some basic ones in Swift."

### Assignment Operator

The assignment operator (`=`) is used either to initialize a value regardless of its type, or update it if it was declared as a variable.

~~~swift
let pokemonName = "Pikachu"
let mirrorPokemonName = pokemonName
mirrorPokemonName // -> "Pikachu"
~~~

The assignment operator does not return a value.

### Arithmetic Operators

Swift comes with all the arithmetic operators you would expect in a modern
programming language.

~~~swift
35 + 10 // -> 45
35 - 10 // -> 25
10 * 2 // -> 20
10 / 3 // -> 3
~~~

The addition operator can also be used to concatenate two or more strings:

~~~swift
"Lightning" + " " + "Rod" // -> "Lightning Rod"
~~~

Or arrays:

~~~swift
let moves = ["Tail Whip", "Thunder Shock"]
let moreMoves = ["Growl", "Play Nice"]
var moveSet = moves + moreMoves
moveSet // -> ["Tail Whip", "Thunder Shock", "Growl", "Play Nice"]
~~~

### Range Operators

Range operators allow you to express a range of a values using lower and upper
bounds. They come in two flavors.

The *closed range operator* includes the value corresponding to the upper bound:

~~~swift
moveSet[1...2] // -> ["Thunder Shock", "Growl"]
~~~

The *half-closed* range operator omits the value corresponding to the upper
bound:

~~~swift
moveSet[1..<2] // -> ["Thunder Shock"]
~~~

### Remainder Operator

The remainder operator (`%`) outputs the remainder of a division of two numbers:

~~~swift
10 % 3 // -> 1
~~~

It also works with floats and negative numbers:

~~~swift
35 % -15 // -> 5
10 % 3.5 // -> 3.0
~~~

### Compound Assignment Operators

These operators execute an operation and assign the result to
the left operand at the same time:

~~~swift
var remainingHP = 35
remainingHP += 10 // -> 45 (remainingHP = remainingHP + 10)
remainingHP -= 10 // -> 35 (remainingHP = remainingHP - 10)
remainingHP *= 2 // -> 70 (remainingHP = remainingHP * 2)
remainingHP /= 2 // -> 35 (remainingHP = remainingHP / 2)
remainingHP %= 6 // -> 5 (remainingHP = remainingHP % 6)
~~~

### Unary Operators

Swift has all the unary operators that are common in other languages:

~~~swift
remainingHP = 35
++remainingHP // -> 36
--remainingHP // -> 35

let damageToKO = -remainingHP // -> -35
+damageToKO // -> -35
~~~

Note that the unary *plus* operator is just syntactic sugar and does not change
the value it was prepended to.

If the increment or decrement operators are appended as postfix operators
(`value++`), the variable is modified *after* its value is returned:

~~~swift
remainingHP // -> 35
remainingHP-- // -> 35
remainingHP // -> 34
~~~

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are binary operators that compare two values and return a
boolean:

~~~swift
35 == 35 // -> true (is equal)
180 != 35 // -> true (is not equal)

180 > 35 // -> true (is greater than)
35 < 180 // -> true (is less than)

35 >= 35 // -> true (is greater than or equal)
180 <= 35 // -> false (is less than or equal)
~~~

### Logical Operators

Swift has three logical operators that all return a boolean value:

- The NOT operator (`!value`) inverts a boolean value.
- The AND operator (`value1 && value2`) returns `true` if all values are
  `true`.
- The OR operator (`value1 || value2`) returns `true` if at least one value is
  `true`.

~~~swift
var damage = 56
var lastPokemon = true
var oneHitKO = (damage > remainingHP) // -> true

!oneHitKO // -> false
!oneHitKO && lastPokemon // -> false
!oneHitKO || lastPokemon // -> true
~~~
