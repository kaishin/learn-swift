### Declaring Tuples

Tuples group multiple values of possibly different types. They are declared using
parentheses:

~~~swift
let alertMode = (4, "Red")
~~~

To explicitly set the type:

~~~swift
let evasionMode: (Int, String) = (3, "Orange")
~~~

You can also name the values for easier access:

~~~swift
let cautionMode = (level: 2, color: "Lime")
~~~

### Getting Tuple Values

Use dot syntax to access the value stored at a given index:

~~~swift
let alertColor = alertMode.1 // -> "Red"
~~~

You can also use the following syntax to retrieve some values while ignoring others:

~~~swift
let (_, evasionColor) = evasionMode
evasionColor // -> "Orange"
let (evasionLevel, _) = evasionMode
evasionLevel // -> 3
~~~

If the values were named during declaration, you can access them using
their names:

~~~swift
let cautionColor = cautionMode.color // -> "Lime"
~~~

### Updating Tuple Values

Declare tuples as variables in order to be able to update their values, then use
dot syntax (with indices or names) to do so:

~~~swift
var normalMode = (1, "Blue")
normalMode.1 = "Green"
normalMode // -> (1, "Green")
~~~
